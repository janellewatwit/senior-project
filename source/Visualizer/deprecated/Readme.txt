Everything in here was used for testing purposes and such has not been maintained. 
I felt it was nice to keep these in as milestones.

A lot of the testing software was in part created by GPT, and through watching SDL documentation, as the majority of the proceedure is the same.
Though, the comments were not extensively updated!
