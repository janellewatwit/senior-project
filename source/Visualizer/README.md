# Visualizer
This application focuses on converting audio signals into visible sound bars. The application is dependent on Visualizer.cpp
primarily, and uses FFT or Fast Fourier Transformation (Turkey Cooley Algorithm) in order to convert
raw audio data into frequencies which are used for representation

## Updates
	Visualizer is indepedent now, can make with visualizer (not ideal, but it does work)
	Main is original test with song

## IN DEVELOPMENT
	Debugging assisted by Open AI - GPT 4.0


## TO BE EDITED 
	Code was cleaned


## Credits
	SDL3 - https://www.libsdl.org/
	ADD RESOURCES FOR FFT
